# Image-Classification-Deep-Learning
This repo is for learning and implementation of deep learning and its various applications. Each jupyter notebook is a tutorial on applying deep learning using tensorflow, keras and python libraries on dataset obtained from public sources.

For this project, create a virtual environment in conda. Install pip, matplotlib, tensorflow. Set this conda environment on jupyter notebook, by installing ipykernel. 

The Read Me will be updated as when progress is made.
